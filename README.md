# XBox-Controller-Windows
Gather Controller Data for alternate uses

The XInput header Library for C++ is demo-ed around the web.  Many Examples are missing the pragma statements to properly link the library for use in VS.  This is a funcional demonstration that displays controller data in real time, just connect it up and run the script.<br>
Would make a great starting point for drone control, cnc jogging, and other robotic enguagements.
