Gather Controller Data for alternate uses

The XInput header Library for C++ is demo-ed around the web.  Many Examples are missing the settings or pragma statements to properly link the library for use in VS.  This is a funcional demonstration that displays controller data in real time, just connect it up and run the script.<br><br>
Would make a great starting point for drone control, CNC jogging, or other robotic enguagements.
